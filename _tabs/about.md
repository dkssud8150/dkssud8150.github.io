## Hello, World!

👋 Hi, my name is Jae Ho YooN.<br>
👥 I have much experience about communication while doing many activities and project.<br>
👨‍💻 I'm interested in Computer Vision on **autonomous driving.**<br>
🤖 I would like to develop autonomous driving software that do not require any personal control via OpenCV or pytorch.<br>
💻 I'm putting down and share my studying review on my blog and <a class="highlight-link" href="https://www.notion.so/18490713817d403696812c57d0abe730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Notion</a>. e.g) some thesis about *object detection* and <a class="highlight-link" href="https://cs231n.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> CS231N</a>.<br> 
📝 I'm aiming to share my code reimplementing thesis by myself and project that uses it.
📈 and, my goal in this year is to achieve top 5 performance on DACON contest or my deep neural network outperforms all of the existing 3D Object Detection work combining many cameras with LIDAR sensors.
